# VLSI-AI-Floorplanning-using-RL-GNN-PPO

An AI-driven VLSI floorplanning framework that combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** reinforcement learning to automate macro and standard-cell placement while minimizing wirelength and eliminating overlaps.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional VLSI floorplanning techniques rely heavily on simulated annealing, heuristic optimization, and manual tuning. As modern netlists scale into millions of components, these approaches become computationally expensive and difficult to optimize globally.

This project introduces an intelligent floorplanning pipeline where:

- A **netlist** is modeled as a graph
- A **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** extracts structural and connectivity features
- A **PPO Reinforcement Learning Agent** learns optimal placement strategies
- The system minimizes:
  - **HPWL (Half-Perimeter Wirelength)**
  - **Cell overlaps**
  - **Congestion**
  - **Illegal placements**

The framework is capable of learning placement policies through iterative interaction with a custom Gymnasium environment.
